# Favicon Setup Options

Since the full Logo1.png might not work well as a favicon, here are better alternatives:

## Option 1: Simple Text Favicon
Create a simple "IT" text favicon using the same blue color scheme

## Option 2: Icon-Only Favicon  
Extract just the code symbol (`</>`) from your logo and use that

## Option 3: Letter-Based Favicon
Use just the letters "IT" in a clean, simple design

## Option 4: Use a Generic Tech Icon
Use a simple, clean tech-related icon that represents your business

## Recommended Approach

For now, let me create a simple favicon using CSS and HTML that matches your brand colors. This will be clean, scalable, and professional.

Would you like me to:
1. Create a simple CSS-based favicon with "IT" text
2. Help you design a new simplified favicon
3. Use a generic tech icon temporarily
4. Extract just the icon part from your existing logo

What would you prefer?
